        <h2>about me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! I&apos;m a budding front-end developer on the lookout for an
          exhilarating opportunity in the tech realm. My forte lies in crafting
          HTML that&apos;s accessible to everyone, harnessing the latest CSS
          techniques, and weaving pristine JavaScript code. My JavaScript
          expertise primarily orbits around React, but I&apos;m all about
          versatilityâ€”ready to embrace any tool that the job demands. While
          rooted in Accra, Ghana, I thrive in remote work setups, seasoned with
          a solid background in collaborative remote teams. Beyond the screen,
          you&apos;ll catch me reveling in the great outdoors. Whether it&apos;s
          strolling, jogging, or pedaling through nature&apos;s wonders, count me in!
          Curious about my work? I&apos;d be thrilled for you to take a peek.
